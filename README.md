# 🧠 Heart Disease Prediction – End-to-End Data Science Workflow

This repository contains a complete Data Science workflow applied to a heart disease dataset. The goal is to explore, preprocess, analyze, and model the data to predict the presence of heart disease. The project follows a structured pipeline from raw data collection to model evaluation and visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical and demographic features.
- **Approach**: An end-to-end machine learning pipeline including:
  - Data acquisition & preprocessing
  - Balancing the dataset
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Model building and evaluation

## 🔍 Milestones

### 1. Data Collection
- Data sourced from a CSV file (can be extended via APIs or web scraping).
- Loaded using Pandas and inspected for relevant columns.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Selected only the required data points (balancing between 'Yes' and 'No' heart disease cases).
- Combined the two groups to form a balanced dataset.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for rich interactive visualizations.
- Distribution analysis, correlation heatmaps, and categorical feature inspection.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Scaled numerical features for optimal performance.

### 5. Model Development
- Applied different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
